## Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Model

# Overview
---

This AI-powered Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Model uses deep learning techniques, specifically a U-Net architecture, to classify tumor-prone regions in MRI scans. The model color-codes different risk levels:

Red: High risk (severe tumor-prone areas)
Yellow: Moderate risk
Green: Low risk or tumor-free regions

The model incorporates advanced image processing techniques, including skull removal, heatmaps, and segmentation overlays for precise analysis.

# Features:

  -Deep Learning-Based Segmentation: Uses U-Net for accurate classification of tumor-prone areas.

  -Color-Coded Risk Mapping: Highlights tumor severity for better visualization.

  -Skull Removal Preprocessing: Enhances MRI scan clarity by eliminating non-relevant structures.

  -Automated Heatmap Generation: Provides intuitive visual insights for medical professionals.

  -Scalability for Rural Healthcare: Can be integrated with telemedicine solutions for remote diagnoses.

# Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python

  -Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

  -Transformers,attention mechanism, transfer model

  -Data Processing: Image normalization, augmentation, skull stripping

  -Deployment Options: Web-based API, Cloud Integration
