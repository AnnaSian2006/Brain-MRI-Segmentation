Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Model

Overview

This AI-powered Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Model uses deep learning techniques, specifically a U-Net architecture, to classify tumor-prone regions in MRI scans. The model color-codes different risk levels:

Red: High risk (severe tumor-prone areas)
Yellow: Moderate risk
Green: Low risk or tumor-free regions

The model incorporates advanced image processing techniques, including skull removal, heatmaps, and segmentation overlays for precise analysis.

Features:

-Deep Learning-Based Segmentation: Uses U-Net for accurate classification of tumor-prone areas.

-Color-Coded Risk Mapping: Highlights tumor severity for better visualization.

-Skull Removal Preprocessing: Enhances MRI scan clarity by eliminating non-relevant structures.

-Automated Heatmap Generation: Provides intuitive visual insights for medical professionals.

-Scalability for Rural Healthcare: Can be integrated with telemedicine solutions for remote diagnoses.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python

-Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Transformers,attention mechanism, transfer model

-Data Processing: Image normalization, augmentation, skull stripping

-Deployment Options: Web-based API, Cloud Integration
